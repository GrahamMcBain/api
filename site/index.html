      <h3>Moov API Documentation</h3>

      <p>
        Moov builds all services with API endpoints to extend functionality and offer automated usability of our services. Our mission is to give developers an easy way to create and integrate bank processing into their own software products. Our projects are focused on solving a single responsibility capability in financial services. Each project can be leveraged as a RESTFul service or Golang library and are built from source into an OS specific binary and docker container. Deployment of Moov projects can be deployed as a binary on your application server or as a docker container.
